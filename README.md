# kalman_filter_python
To track and peredict the trajectory of an object by using Kalman Filter

It takes the series of measurements overtime and predict the next position. 
It can be used in computer vision appplications, sensors, GPS, senarios where you loose the signals for some moments.
Here in this figure, red ones are the real data points and green ones are the predcitons by using Klamna Filter.
