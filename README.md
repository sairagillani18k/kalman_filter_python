# Kalman Filter (Python)
An algorithm to track and peredict the trajectory of an object by using Kalman Filter

It takes the series of measurements overtime and predicts the next position. 
Can be used in Computer Visin appplications. 
It can be used in sensors , GPS , in senarios where you loose the signals for some time.
Here in this figure, oranges are the real data points and Green ones are the predcitons by using Kalman Filter.
