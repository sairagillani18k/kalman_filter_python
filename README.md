# kalman_filter_python
To track and peredict the trajectory of an object by using Kalman Filter

It take sthe series of measurements overtime and predict the next position. 
Can be used in Computer Visin appplications. 
It can be used in sensors , GPS , in senarios where you you loose the signals for some moments.
Here in this figure, range nes are the real data points and Green ones are the predcitons by using Klamna Filter.
